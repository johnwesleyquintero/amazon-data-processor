## Project Overview

The **Amazon Data Processor** is a web application built using the Flask framework. Its primary purpose is to ingest, process, and display Amazon SQP and Ads Campaign data in a user-friendly interface. This facilitates better decision-making and strategy development for marketing campaigns on Amazon.

## Key Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Upload SQP and Ads Campaign reports directly into the app.
- **Data Processing**: Automatically cleans and processes data for accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Displays key metrics through interactive charts and tables.
- **Export Options**: Allows for exporting processed data in various formats.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that the following are installed:

- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Project Setup Checklist

#### Update Script:

1. Modify `create_project_structure` for Flask.
2. Add folders: `templates`, `uploads`, `static`.
3. Add files: `app.py`, `upload.html`, `requirements.txt`.

#### Run Script:

1. Save the script as `setup_script.py`.
2. Run: `python setup_script.py`.
3. Follow prompts:
   - **Name**: Enter the project name.
   - **Type**: Select `flask`.
   - **Overwrite**: Choose `n` (no).
   - **Install deps**: Choose `y` (yes).

#### Add Flask Code:

1. Update `app.py` with project logic.
2. Update `upload.html` with the upload form.
3. Add any extra files (e.g., `config.yaml`).

#### Test Locally:

1. Activate virtual environment:
   - **Linux/macOS**: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - **Windows**: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app:

bash
python app.py
Test at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Commit & Push:

bash
git add .
Commit changes:

bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Push to remote repository:

bash
git push origin main
GitHub Actions:
Create .github/workflows/test.yml for CI.

Commit & push:

bash
git add .github/workflows/test.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI workflow"
git push origin main
Deploy App:
Google Cloud:

bash
gcloud run deploy
Heroku:

bash
git push heroku main
Update README:
Add description, features, setup, usage, deployment details.

Commit & push:

bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README with project details"
git push origin main
Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourrepository/amazon-data-processor.git
cd amazon-data-processor
Run the Setup Script
Use the provided setup.py script to streamline the setup process.

bash
python setup.py amazon-data-processor --type flask --overwrite --install-deps
This command will:

Create the project structure.

Set up a virtual environment.

Install all dependencies from requirements.txt.

Activate the Virtual Environment
After running the setup script, activate the virtual environment.

On Windows:

bash
amazon-data-processor\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
source amazon-data-processor/venv/bin/activate
Usage Guide
Running the Application
With the virtual environment activated, start the Flask development server.

bash
flask run
The app should now be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

Uploading Data
Navigate to the Upload page.

Use the provided interface to upload Amazon SQP and Ads Campaign CSV files.

The app supports single and batch uploads.

Processing and Viewing Data
Upon upload, the app automatically processes the data:

Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and corrects data types.

Data Transformation: Aggregates and summarizes key metrics.

Go to the Dashboard to view interactive visualizations:

Search Query Performance: Top search terms, conversion rates, etc.

Ads Campaign Metrics: Click-through rates, cost analysis, ROI.

Export processed data from the Export section in formats like CSV, Excel, or PDF.

Core Principles for Pipeline Engineering
To ensure smooth operation and continuous improvement, the following core principles should guide our pipeline engineering efforts:

Proactive Error Identification and Resolution

Stay Vigilant: Regularly monitor the pipeline for any errors or inconsistencies.

Root Cause Analysis: Investigate issues thoroughly to address underlying causes.

Swift Action: Prioritize rapid resolution to minimize downtime.

Automation for Efficiency

Automate Repetitive Tasks: Implement scripts and tools to handle routine processes.

Continuous Improvement: Refine automation to enhance performance and reliability.

Robust CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

Continuous Integration: Automate testing and validation of code changes.

Continuous Deployment: Streamline deployment processes for rapid release cycles.

Testing Integration: Incorporate comprehensive tests to maintain code quality.

Comprehensive Documentation

Maintain Clear Records: Document all pipeline configurations and changes.

Accessible Knowledge Base: Centralize documentation for team accessibility.

Update Regularly: Keep documentation current with latest practices.

Adherence to Security Best Practices

Secure Credential Handling: Use secure methods for managing API keys and sensitive data.

Compliance: Ensure all processes align with data protection regulations.

Regular Audits: Periodically review for potential security vulnerabilities.

Scalability and Future-Proofing

Design for Growth: Build the pipeline to handle increasing data volumes.

Modular Architecture: Adopt modular designs for easy updates and maintenance.

Embrace New Technologies: Stay updated on tools that enhance the pipeline.

Effective Communication and Collaboration

Regular Updates: Keep the team informed about pipeline status and changes.

Collaborative Problem Solving: Engage with team members to address challenges.

Feedback Loop: Encourage and act on feedback to improve workflows.

Monitoring and Logging

Implement Monitoring Tools: Use tools to track performance and resource usage.

Centralized Logging: Collect logs for analysis and troubleshooting.

Alerting Mechanisms: Configure alerts for critical issues.

Resource Optimization

Efficient Utilization: Optimize computational and storage resources.

Cleanup Routines: Regularly remove unnecessary files or data.

Backup and Recovery Planning

Regular Backups: Backup important data and configurations.

Disaster Recovery: Have plans in place for quick recovery from incidents.
